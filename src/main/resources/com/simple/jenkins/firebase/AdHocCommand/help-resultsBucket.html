<div>
    The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored (default:
    <code>test-lab-${random-UUID}</code>). Note that the bucket must be owned by a billing-enabled project, and that
    using a non-default bucket will result in billing charges for the storage used.
